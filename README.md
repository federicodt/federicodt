# **Hi! I'm Federico.**



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federico Teijeiro was born the year Muhammad Ali announced his return to boxing. He has traveled through acting, advertising and computer engineering courses. He even considered being a seminarian. He finally found his calling: to investigate and tell stories. Adults follow paths. The children explore. That's why he became a journalist, because they are allowed to ask questions and find out how the world works. He is a Journalist, with a Master degree and Professor, dedicated to research; especially corruption and money laundering. He considers the news to be the first draft of history. He also specializaed in public spending, sports and politics, aeronautical issues; among others. He did the Summer Investigative Reporting Course at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. He is now attending the Lede Program, an intensive data journalism course, also at Columbia.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first woke up one spring; hence he has the transition built into him. From an early age he was fascinated by mysteries and puzzles. He likes leap years and he is obsessed with direct verbs. He is more nostalgic than melancholic. He doesn't believe in coincidences. He is fond of blues, basketball and chess; among others. He was always surrounded by books and well-prepared mates (an Argentine drink, similar in taste to tea). He lived more than a thousand adventures, one for each book read. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't possess any special talents, he's just passionately curious. He would usually do anything as long as it felt like an adventure. He believes that the secret is in the details. He usually does not remember what he dreams and silence does not bother him, as long as the body screams. He maintains that the best journey is inside oneself and still seeks the sound of his own voice. But he loves and needs the feeling of an airplane taking off. He currently strings words together as he continues to learn to write and to live.
